                <p>I hold a Bachelor's degree in BBA in International business and trade from Inha University, South Korea, which I successfully earned in 2022. My academic journey at Inha University provided me with a diverse range of experiences and opportunities for intellectual growth. It was during this time that I deepened my knowledge and skills in my chosen field, collaborating with professors and peers on research projects, and participating in academic and extracurricular activities.

                    Before my university years, I completed my high school education at Gyankunj Secondary School, located in the picturesque landscapes of Nepal. This educational foundation not only equipped me with fundamental knowledge but also instilled in me a strong work ethic and a passion for learning. My high school experiences were formative and laid the groundwork for my pursuit of higher education and professional development.
                    
                    These academic experiences, both in South Korea and Nepal, have contributed significantly to my personal and intellectual growth, shaping me into a dedicated and well-rounded individual with a thirst for knowledge and a commitment to excellence.".</p>
